# Accelerator TextChat for Javascript<br/>

## Quick start

The OpenTok Text Chat Accelerator Pack provides functionality you can add to your OpenTok applications that enables users to exchange text messages between mobile or browser-based devices.

This [sample](https://github.com/opentok/one-to-one-textchat-sample-apps) shows you how to use the accelerator pack.

## Install

```bash
$ npm install --save opentok-text-chat
```

If using browserify or webpack:

```javascript
const textChat = require('opentok-text-chat');
```

Otherwise, include the accelerator pack in your html:

```html
<script src="../your/path/to/opentok-text-chat.js"></script>
```
 . . . and it will be available in global scope as `TextChatAccPack`
